## GDPR
Uber prepares for EU GDPR after facing fines for hiding their data breach. 

## Privacy Features and Tools
* Ride Check
    * Ride Check flags long, unexpected stops during a route. In such instances, Uber will send notifications to the driver and passenger to check that stop was requested. If there is cause for concern, either the driver or passenger can press an emergency button in the app. The new Ride Check feature also may automatically detect a crash. If the app notices a sudden spike in a vehicle’s acceleration — it does so by harnessing GPS, sensors in the phone and other trip data — it can send a notification to a driver and passenger to make sure they’re ok, and if required summon 911 emergency assistance.
* Elastic Sensitivity
    * Imagine Uber data analysts want to figure out what the average distance is for a ride in San Francisco. They’ll need to query large swathes of data about rides in the city, but pulling that thread could expose lots of information about individual riders and drivers. Differential privacy scrambles the data and injects noise, making it impossible to trace trip information back to a particular user.
    In order to calculate that sensitivity, Uber partnered with a team of security researchers from the University of California, Berkeley. The researchers worked for over a year to come up with the calculation technique, nicknamed Elastic Sensitivity, which Uber is releasing today as an open-source tool.Elastic Sensitivity will make it possible for analysts at Uber—and elsewhere—to quickly adapt differential privacy standards to a variety of queries. Previously, an analyst would have queried a database and then tried to weed out sensitive or unnecessary data after the fact. Now, data will come out clean.



# Data Breaches
### Data Breach 1 
* Date: 2016
* Reason: Hacking/Stolen and Cover Up 
* Explanation: The breach, revealed in 2017, granted hackers access to the personal information of 57 million riders and drivers. The company concealed the hack for more than a year, Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi said in statement at the time.
Uber paid the hackers $100,000 to delete the data and keep the breach quiet, rather than report the incident.
* Affected Users: 57 million riders and drivers
* Steps Taken:  Uber has agreed to pay $148 million in connection with a 2016 data breach and subsequent cover-up, according to the California Attorney General's office.
