## GDPR
Amazon is really passionate to comply with GDPR. In addition to our own compliance, AWS is committed to offering services and resources to our customers to help them comply with GDPR requirements that may apply to their activities. New features are launched regularly, and AWS has 500+ features and services focused on security and compliance.

## Privacy Features and Tools
Amazon.com posted a new privacy policy on its Web site that's aimed at giving online shoppers a better idea of exactly what happens to the personal information they willingly give the company -- not to mention the data they inadvertently leave behind.
One key modification made by Amazon is a promise that it won't trade personal data to other companies without first getting permission from individual customers. The company previously reserved the right to buy, sell and trade such information at will, although the spokeswoman said it never actually did so.
