## Data Breaches
### Data Breach 1
* Date: October 2018
* Reason: Poor Safety
* Explanation: Google initiated a security audit at the beginning of 2018 to review what data third-party app developers had access to via Google accounts. As a result, the company found that between 2015 and March 2018, outside app developers, could have potentially accessed private Google Plus user profile data, due to a software glitch in the site.
* User Affected: 500,000 Google Plus users
* Steps Taken: While Google has fixed the coding glitch, it is "sunsetting" the consumer version of Google Plus and will complete the shutdown by August 2019. Users will be offered information over the coming months on how to download and save their Google Plus data.
Google is also working on developing additional controls and updating policies for its APIs. The company will also create more granular Google account permissions for users. "When an app prompts you for access to your Google account data, we always require that you see what data it has asked for, and you must grant it explicit permission," the company said. Apps will be required to show you each requested permission individually.
