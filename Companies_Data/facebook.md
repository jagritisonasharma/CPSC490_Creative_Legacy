Yes, Facebook has set new terms that users will have agree to, in order to comply with GDPR.
Most of its new laws are in terms of alerting people about the privacy features.

## Privacy Features and Tools

the setting while making the post or go back to older posts and change it later. 
### Apps

This part of the tool shows you each app attached to your account and what sharing permissions it has. These settings also control who can see that you have the app installed.
