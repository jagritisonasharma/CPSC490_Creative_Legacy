## GDPR
Yes, Facebook has set new terms that users will have agree to, in order to comply with GDPR.
Most of its new laws are in terms of alerting people about the privacy features. 
In the EU facial recognition will become opt-in, but it remains opt-out for the rest of the world.

## Privacy Features and Tools
### Posts:
You can check your default sharing setting. You can also cusomtize the selection, to remove or pick certain friends. You can change 
the setting while making the post or go back to older posts and change it later. 
### Apps
Each app on the site you agreed to install has permission to post to your Friends list unless you told it otherwise at the time you installed it. Can't remember? This part of the tool shows you each app attached to your account and what sharing permissions it has. These settings also control who can see that you have the app installed.
If you don't use the app anymore, just delete it by clicking on the x.
### Profile
Here you can see the privacy setting on your email addresses, birthday, hometown, relationship status and other personal details about your life. Under emails it will show the one you registered with when you first signed up for Facebook as well as one Facebook has assigned to you (which you likely will never use). All the information can be editing and the share settings can be modified. 
### Timeline and Tagging
It's set by default to Friends and the only other option is to allow only yourself to post on your timeline. If you are concerned about getting tagged in a photo that you don't want all your friends on Facebook to see, enable the setting "review posts friends tag you in before they appear on your timeline". Once enabled, you'll have to manually approve any photo or posts you are tagged in before they appear on your timeline. Note that this only affects your timeline; those updates will still appear in searches, the news feed and other places unless you un-tag yourself.

## Data Breaches
### Data Breach 1
* Date: March 2018

* Records lost: 29,000,000
* Steps Taken:

### Data Breach 2
* Date: October 2018
* Reason: Hackers
* Explanation:  Hackers exploited a bug that affected its "View As" feature, which lets people see what their profiles look like to someone else. That would let attackers steal "access tokens," which are digital keys that Facebook uses to keep people logged in. Possession of those tokens would allow attackers to "seize control" of user accounts, Facebook said.
* Records lost: 50,000,000
* Steps Taken: Facebook reset some logins, so 90 million people have been logged out and will have to log in again. That includes anyone who has been subject to a "View As" lookup in the past year.

### Data Breach 3
* Date: January 2019
* Reason: Poor Security 
* Explanation:  A Photo API bug gave app developers too much access to the photos of up to 6.8 million users. The bug allowed apps users had approved to pull their timeline photos to also receive their Facebook Stories, Marketplace photos, and most worryingly, photos they’d uploaded to Facebook but never shared. 
* Records lost: 6,800,000
* Steps Taken: Facebook says the bug ran for 12 days from September 13th to September 25th. Facebook tells TechCrunch it discovered the breach on September 25th, and informed the European Union’s privacy watchdog the Office Of The Data Protection Commissioner (IDPC) on November 22nd 2018. Facebook provided an apology. It also provided tools for app developers to check if they were impacted and it worked with them to delete photos they shouldn’t have. The company notified people it suspects may have been impacted by the bug via Facebook notification that will direct them to the Help Center where they’ll see if they used any apps impacted by the bug. It’s recommending users log into apps to check if they have wrongful photo access.
