# CPSC490_Creative_Legacy
The following is the Creative Legacy Assignment for CPSC 490. 
This is an open source project, and anyone can add and keep the list of companies growing. 


## Audience
This project is intended for users who want to access information on a company's implemented privacy and ethics policies and protocols. 

## Legacy
This project would be available so that it can be used regularly as the first point of brief research regarding company security and privacy policy summaries and histories. It will be impactful as it will collate lots of disorganized data and always be available to help with any sort of research in the future. It is also self-sustainable as anyone can contribute to the project to keep adding new companies and more information.
