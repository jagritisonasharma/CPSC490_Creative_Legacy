# CPSC490_Creative_Legacy
The following is the Creative Legacy Assignment for CPSC 490. 
This is an open source project, and anyone can add and keep the list of companies growing. 

Thanks to all contributors, you're awesome and wouldn't be possible without you! The goal is to build a categorized community-driven collection of very well-known resources and information. 

## The Project and Goal


## Inspiration 
Inspiration for this project stemmed from this website: https://informationisbeautiful.net/visualizations/worlds-biggest-data-breaches-hacks/ 
However, this website data is centrally maintained and  the list of companies  cannot grow because there is no community. This project is overcoming these limitations, by making an opensource solution maintained by community that does not only focus on the top 20/50 companies. 
This project will also expand on the data on the webstie regarding the number of records lost in the breach and have more information regarding the data breaches, privacy laws...etc. 

## Legacy
This project would be available so that it can be used regularly as the first point of brief research regarding company security and privacy policy summaries and histories. It will be impactful as it will collate lots of disorganized data and always be available to help with any sort of research in the future. It is also self-sustainable as anyone can contribute to the project to keep adding new companies and more information.
